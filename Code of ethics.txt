# Code of Ethics

I, a Data practitioner, will promote the well-being of others and myself while striving to do no harm with data through:

1. Professional application of analytical techniques
2. Humility in analytic claims
3. Anticipation of legal and regulatory scenarios
4. Transparency in computation and documentation
5. Fidelity to this oath beyond bottom line
