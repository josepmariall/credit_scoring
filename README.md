This projects uses banking data to predict credit scoring, in other words, wether a person can be graned a new credit or not. 

According to [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_scoring.asp), Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to access a person's creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scoring, among other things, to decide on whether to extend or deny credit.
